    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>
      Phoenix Studio ("we", "our", or "us") built the Words on Beat app (the
      "App") as a freemium application. This page informs you of our policies
      regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when
      you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses anonymous authentication through Firebase to provide its
      services. We do not require you to create an account or provide personal
      information such as your name or email address.
    </p>

    <h2>Audio Recording</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses your device's microphone to record audio for the purpose of
      speech-to-text transcription and pronunciation scoring. Audio recordings
      are temporarily uploaded to our servers for processing and are
      automatically deleted after transcription is complete. We do not store,
      share, or use your audio recordings for any other purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses the following third-party services that may collect
      information:
    </p>
    <p>
      - Google Play Services<br />
      - Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage)<br />
      - OpenAI Whisper API (audio transcription)<br />
      - Google AdMob (advertising)
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these services has its own privacy policy governing the use of
      information they collect.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The App may display advertisements provided by Google AdMob. AdMob may use
      device identifiers and usage data to serve personalized or
      non-personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising through
      your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The App offers in-app purchases processed through Google Play. Payment
      information is handled entirely by Google Play and is not collected or
      stored by us.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of
      protecting your information. However, no method of transmission over the
      internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children
      under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has
      provided us with personal information, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>
